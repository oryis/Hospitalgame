You Found yourself Standing in the abandoned hospital's lobby,
 and a faint echo of distant footsteps. 
 filled with dusty chandelier hanging from the ceiling, 
 and flicking dying lights surrounded by forgotten wheelchairs.
  Against the wall stands a big wooden Cabinet overed in rust.
 A ghostly figure of a former receptionist occasionally appears, whispering clues about the hospital's secrets.
